<strong>2. First Group Interaction (30-35 minutes)</strong>

Note: For newcomers give a 1-2 minute explanation of Grow:

<b>THE JOURNEY – FOR BEGINNING GROWERS</b>

What is Grow?

Grow is a mutual help movement working in the field of mental health. Grow wishes to make a connection with everybody – those of all religions and those of none. Essential to Grow’s message is that we reach out and connect with something beyond ourselves. Within this text the word ‘God’ is used sparingly. The hope is that the term ‘Greater Power’ is more accommodating – to those of all religions and those of none.

Our meetings are anonymous, non-denominational and open to all. Since the groups are run by our own members, quality leadership training is provided.

Groups are small, usually in single figures and last about two hours. They are followed by refreshements. Our meetings are free with small voluntary contributions welcome to cover the venue expenses.

No introductions are needed. Just come along.

Con Keogh, with a small group of other people, started Grow in Sydney, Austrailia in 1957, as an offshoot of Alcoholics Anonymous. It has since spread to other countries coming to Ireland in 1969. The Grow 12 Step Program was born out of the pain and wisdom of people grappling with recovery from various forms of mental illness. From there it quickly evolved into a movement which included personal growth and prevenion as well as recovery.

<b>(i) “Any urgent or pressing problems ?”</b> (Not to be confused with an urgent desire to talk).

<b>(ii) Open Discussion</b> – aim to get a healthy balance of the following ingredients of a good meeting:

    • A Personal Story of journeying towards hope, recovery and growth through Grow;
    
      Note: there are a variety of ways to tell your story
      For a Personal Story consider using the following outline :
    
		• Why I came to Grow.
		• How my life was adversly affected by mental illness, distress or events.
		• What progress I have made.
		• What and who has been helpful.
		• What are the next steps.
    

    • Reports on Progress including follow-up on Practical Tasks. (Leader asks for progress on task and application of Program).
    • Current Problem Solving/Practical Task – relating to the Three Basic Changes. Use 4Ps (One Person, Problem, Practical Task, Part of Program).
    

<strong>3. Middle Routine</strong> (20-30 minutes)

Note: The group is urged to spot and discourage any turning of the discussion back to personal problems.

<b>(i) Now we pass to our Affirmation of Good (p.100) and the Declarations of Trust (p.101)</b>
	– both are voluntary ad profoundly personal and therefore need prior reflection.

<b>THE AFFIRMATION OF GOOD</b>

We believe that our lives up to now have een neither wholly good nor wholly bad.

We believe that we are capable of change and growth.

We Acknowledge and ask pardon for the wrongs we have done and for the needed good that we failed to do.

We freely forgive from our hearts those who have wronged us or failed us – including our own selves.

We hope for ourselves and wish to one another and to every human being, enduring friendships, and end to hostility, and the best in life, love and happiness.


<b>DECLARATIONS OF TRUST</b>

The ethos of Grow is about letting go, about accepting that we need help from others. About accepting there are things outside our control that can help us if we allow them to.

I am capable of being loved, loving myself and loving others.

I am a connecting link and I have a unique part to play in this world.

I accept that my own efforts for self-transformation are irreplaceable.

I commit to practicing patience and perseverence in following The Grow Program.

We as a group will be concerned not just for ourselve sbut for one another.

We commit to being part of a Greater Power, either spiritual or practical, that enables us to reach towards living a freer and better life.


<b>(ii) Sharing of Knowledge</b> (group members will share a piece for understanding from the Grow Program Book).

<b>(iii) Reading and Discussion</b> of Grow material followed by objective discussion of it’s contents. (The reading is shared - a paragraph or two is read by different members)

<b><i>OR</i></b>

Training Session in response to needs/problems of the group – ordinarily no more than once every 8 weeks.

<strong>4. Second Group Interaction</strong> (25-30 mimnutes0

(i) Continue with Reports on Progress and Current Problem Solving including recommendation of Practical Tasks using the 4Ps.

(ii) Not everyone will be included in problem solving. But it is vital that all present get to share their progress reports and take a task.

<strong>5. Group Issues/Forward Planning and Closing Routine</strong> (10 minutes)

Ask the Group Organizer to:

    1. Inform members of Task/Goals set at O&R and Regional Team Meetings.
    2. Make any necessary announcements from the Grow Centre or other sources.
    3. Check last week’s and arrange further volunteer 12th Step Work (friendly contact between Growers and Community Outreach).
    4. Ask someone to quietly prepare refreshments/
    5. Ask the Recorder to obtain and to record on the weekly evaluation sheet, the group’s assessment of the quality of the meeting (all members shoudl answer the Recorder’s questions).
    6. Ask the Are Co-ordinator, if present, to give feedback to the group.
    
    7. Close with the Commitment to the Journey (p.102)
        COMMITMENT TO THE JOURNEY
			I renew my coommitment to a journey of personal growth and change
			I will strive always to see things as they really are, to keep my thinking and my behavior sensible.
			I trust in the care of a Greater Power and in the support of my fellow Grow members.
			
    8. Brief Pause, then the Grow Aspiration (p.103)
		“May the spirit of friendship make us free and whole persons, and gentle builders of a free and whole community.”
		
    9. Announce “Grow has no fees but any voluntary contributions twoards necessary expenses will be welcome”.
